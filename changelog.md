### 3.10
- **Automatic updates**
  - If it upsets you to ALWAYS have to manually update your ACPL, then this release might be the last you'll download.
  - This update brings back the automatic updates, in a revamped way.
  - If a new release is available, it will ask you once you boot the console.
  - If you skip the update, you can still download it by using the console command 'update', or by running `updater_main.py`.
- Types in lists
  - You can define the type of an element in the list when you create it.
  - Syntax : `var:list my_list = list [int:1] [float:1.5] [bool:True] [str:Normal string] [Default is str]`
- Command line arguments for `main.py`
  - When invoking `main.py` from a command prompt, you can add the filename of an ACPL file at the end. It will automatically run it and override the one in the startup file.
- Condtions inside each other
  - **ELSE HAS BEEN REMOVED**
  - By popular opinion, nested `if`s have been preferred to the `else` statement.
  - You can now use multiple `if`s inside each other.
- New libs function
  - A new function is required for libs to get through the compiler : `libs_to_import()`
  - This function returns all the required libs by the final python file this way :
  - If the generated result does not require anything in order to work, just return a tuple containing to empty tuples, this way : `return (tuple(), tuple())`
  - If it only requires to import a full lib, (*example : `sys`*), the first tuple contains that lib : `return (("sys",), tuple())`
  - If you need more of those : `return (("sys", "math", "tkinter"), tuple())`
  - The other tuple contains all the functions from libs. If you want `from json import load`, then : `return (tuple(), (("json", "load"),))`
  - If you want `from json import load, dump`, then : `return (tuple(), (("json", "load, dump"),))`
  - And if you want `from json import load` and `from math import *` : `return (tuple(), (("json", "load"), ("math", "*")))`
- ACPL debugger
  - New console command `debug <file>`
  - This command will start a debugger that will tell you what happens in the ACPL program.
  - The program will tell you what instruction is being expected, what variables are existing at the end of the line, and let you continue it step by step or stop it. This possibility is available at every single line.
- Settings
  - The old rusty `modify-ini` command was very complicated, with many things to remember. *As its creator, I didn't remember those myself !*
  - This command has been changed to `settings`, and doesn't take any arguments.
  - This will pop up a dialog box that will let you customize your settings.
- Bugfixes
  - Lists were buggy with functions. They still are, but less.
  
### 3.10.1
- Bugfixes
  - Corrected a shell from a past dev experience with command `ini-content`
    - Using that command made the console crash
    - Now fully fixed, with revamped version of the command
  - Corrected a problem with the `settings` command
    - When entering wrong values in input fields, and clicking save, the inputs weren't reset
    - It was just a dev error, now fully fixed.
