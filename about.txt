ACPL is a little programming language created by a young french student : TheAssassin.

The goal of this language is to be simple, but mainly, it is just a project to test my skills and learn, so don't expect too much about it ;) !

Technical part :
The language have its syntax coming from everywhere, with python-like parts, JavaScript-like parts, C-like parts, and a lot more.
It is transpiled in Python to be interpreted.
