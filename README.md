# ACPL
My own programming language (compiled in Python).

#### DOCUMENTATION ####
Actually, this program can only print, input, and create variables.

Things to know :
This program works line per line, which means that it is **ONE INSTRUCTION PER LINE**.
You can also use a comma (`;`) to mark the end of the line, but it is not required.
The code has to be in the same folder than the `main.py` file, and inside a file named `code.acpl`.

##### comments ######
You can comment line per line with `#` or `//`.
There is no way to do multiline comments at the moment.

##### print #####
